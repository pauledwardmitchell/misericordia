Felipe attended meetings to interview Energy auditors in mid 2012.",
  "Notes": "Hal - 7/28/15 - Very interested in solar, but project told was too small by Nextility and GB/PEAR not interested. Need to talk to other installers -- perhaps try energysage.com Jasmine - interim church Admin (came to 7/15 meeting) - was very interested in wifi / internet - connect with Sam.  The Board of Trustees is the primary decision-making body. Hal is current chair of trustees.  Key allies include, Fritz von Fleckenstein, Brian Shimming, Marthat Davis.  Robert Dohan -- former Trustees member Brian Shimming -- Current session member Michele Holland, very talented structural engineer is on their team. Bob Dohan is retired lawyer, and used to serve on Trustees, but sometimes comes to meetings. he understands CPA and sometimes can represent us well, but sometimes can nit-pick details.  3/25/15: Tenleytown contract signed. 7/8/2015: Paid $2500; second half to follow 6/6/16 paid for second half ($2500) Dues $300",

But it has been hard to compare to show savings well.  Gas: looking to see savings this upcoming winter. hard to compare during summer months.  James Pearlstein introduced Rev. Kirkland to Felipe. Felipe had 1-on-1 with Kirland in Fall 2013. Was a great leader, but couldn't take on being on steering team. Kirkland has a friend at Georgetown who could be helpful with BWC-UMC. Kirkland started participating in Gas and Electric in Fall 2013. Was a tough pitch for some board members, but ultimately, Parker Brewer, joined on 7/29/15 - briefly recounted historical issues with Pepco broken meter, etc.  Trash - unique situation where they pay $1800/year due to their location in Chevy Chase, streets are narrow, like their current relationship. 9/18/15 - sent email re Sept 30 meeting 1/28/16- talked with Beth about the Jan. 27 meeting; filled her in on the discussion; she is interested in coming to the March 8 Annual meeting as well as one in Feb. 1/29/16 - sent email invite to CPA Annual meeting",

We already have solar panels, and already had negotiated better deals with the providers we used than the CPA could get us.  I know that you are doing work, it just isn't a good fit for us.

  "Notes": "- Supplies:  we currently spend about $4300, so expected savings would be about $430. - - Snow removal:  Annual contract.  We currently pay about $125/hr + supplies.  Last year was higher than normal.  Solar:  yes. - Payroll services:  we have a very small staff and manage this ourselves by a volunteer.  May want to consider later, but not needed at present. Trash:  we currently spend about $1,500 annually.  It's a 4 year contract that expires in May 2016.  Probably some opportunity for modest savings.  Current supplier is quite cheap but service is not great. - Copy machine:  we currently have a 5 year contract that costs us about $250/month.  Contract expires in 2018.  Probably not a lot of savings available here--we have a pretty good deal I think. HVAC:  Currently spend about $4680 annually.  I believe this is a one year contract but couldn't confirm.  Potential savings by your estimate: $350.  Security:  currently spend about $2200 annually.  Do you offer this? - Telephone/internet:  Currently about $3200 annually.  2 year contract, expires Mar 2016. Custodial services:  currently about $7000 annually.  Annual contract renews 1 Apr 2015.  - Exterminator:  currently $885/year.  Probably not much opportunity here.",

They are on the verge of paying $3K to Waste Management to get out of current $1K/month contract; Brian has sent lawyer Joe's info to Tim. They may request waste and landscaping quotes now. Electricity interest, but Nextility may require committee review. Solar interest. 7/29/15:  Using Elegance (aka Unity) for trash now. Will have new B&G Committee cochairs in September; they may pursue gas and electric after those folk  are in place. Check back in October. 3/4/16 - will not attend March 8 meeting but will meet on March 10 to talk about elec and gas, etc. 3/10/16- met with Karen Berry today to talk about elec. and gas and more; their contracts with WGL are up in Sept. 2016; I suggested they could easily check to see what we could do for them by signing up and letting Nextility shop for good prices; also mentioned they could sign a contract with a new company to start at a later date if they chose to do so. She will talk with the Vestry member who handles this because they are looking at that issue now.-- they use Elegant Recycling and Refuse for trash and are very happy with them - they might be a good company for CPA, Miguel Saavedra, CEO, 240-278-2698 - especially since we are looking for more trash vendors - they are relatively small.-- I mentioned CPA members will have access to MARVL - Karen said the Diocese has a Parish Administrators group that meets monthly and has a list serve like ours that she finds very useful. 3/31/16 - Sandy thinks they would be very easy to work with. Very easy to talk with. ",

As a result, chose to join and has become more involved over the years. With new NLC acquisition mid2014 -- there are significant new opportunities to grow this relationship into something much more significant.   Aramark (food service), security, all contracts they are reviewing and would like to see the CPA Options. Oscar Owens - is primary signer. Big Contracts authorized by Larry Hanley. To make Membership Pitch, need to focus on IAF relationship / connectedness and organizing focus for Larry Hanley. ",

Very interested in electricity; may be interested in trash depending on who their current hauler is. Also interested in cleaning supplies, but their janitorial service provides much of what they use. Brian gave membership plug too.  Cindy wasn't sure which of these areas could be done in conjunction with the school and which would be church only.",

We need to follow-up with Isaac or Pam (the assistant) to ask about contract end dates for both gas and electric.  Follow-up Items 1) when do gas and electric contracts end? 2) Send us signed TOS with Nextility. 3) Explain basic economics & give them solar proposal by asking Solar Solution LLC to give agreement 4) Ask them to complete Trash inquiry form / or we should fill it out for them based on the bill they sent  5) Give them access to Staples Advantage -- they told us they don't have a credit card, to tell them to call / ask about how they create an account if they don't have a credit card. They currently just get invoiced by Staples.  11/13/15 - Felipe provided a trash quote to Rev. Booney & Ms. Bradley 11/17/15 - Rev. Booney attended Nov. 10 meeting; his form indicated a large no. of interest areas that needed immediate attention due to their budget prep. timing; called and sent email requesting phone call with Felipe as follow-up from Nov. 10 meeting. SM 12/02/15 - Nextility sent contract; will follow up with Pamela Bradley; I spoke with Pamela. Pastor Booney would have to sign and he is out of the office. She is going to try to reach him to have him come back and sign. I reminded her that the contract had to be signed by 4:00pm today. 12/3/15 - Rev. Bonney said the quote from Nextility will be signed today and returned; was signed for gas 12/07/15 - Informed Rev. Bonney of very small power savings at this time; he agreed that we should continue shopping for them. ",

Felipe, in another capacity, met the Pastor several times.",
  "Notes": "9/18/15 - sent email re Sept 30 meeting also sent separate email re CPA Spoke with Admin, Regina who was adamant that we contact Ms. Hunter due to potential savings on trash 12/14/15 - spoke with Sandra Hunter; very interested in trash hauling; wants info on CPA sent - done; will look at the website too. Likely to meet with me after that on Dec. 29; wants to start the New Year off with that kind of savings. 12/28-15 - Ms. Hunter rescheduled our meeting from today until 10:30am Jan. 5th due to illness 1/5/16 - visited Sandra Hunter, staff and Iris a member to pitch CPA; seemed very interested in many of the CPA programs but trash in particular. Currently have Bates with no contract and VERY unhappy with their service a cost $436/month; they said Bates doesn't recycle. Concerned about changing gas providers; offered a CPA member as reference. Iris was familiar with WIN and said so was their Pastor, Rev. Trent. Iris said she has a friend who works with charter schools who might have an interest in CPA. Iris also went over the CPA website and was impressed with who are members. They currently use Dacon for supplies like tp, etc. and feel they are too expensive. They are very interested in janitorial services. 1/7/16 - Felipe asked Tenley Town Trash for a quote for them for 6 cans with pick up of 2 times/week and maybe additional special pick ups. 1/8/16 - sent email to Sandra Hunter with Tenleytown quote and copy of a contract. She responded that she feels like there are a number of areas where CPA can save them money. 1/11/16 - spoke with Iris Toyer, Chair Bd. of Trustees about trash & cleaning and office supplies; she gave CPA info to Rev. Trent and suggested to contact several organizations where either Rev. Trent participates of she knew of that might be interested in CPA's services - Alliance of Church Trustees, Wed. Clergy Group, a group of churches trying to impact DC Gov. that is much more than Baptists; and a friend who developed a charter school and had a similar idea for what CPA does. 1/20/16 - spoke again re: how to connect with ACE Hardware using website & process; ACE's Michael will also call her at my request 1/28/16 - Wayne from ACE Hardware will call Sandi today; they signed a contract with Tenleytown Trash and will set up their first pickup; they also signed up with Staples 2/4/16 - sent Sandra an email re: Feb 10 meeting and will call 2/4/16 - long conversation with Iris Toyer, Chair of the Board of Trustees about 100 people merging with Fl Ave. and growing the congregation; send info on the meeting on Feb. 10; she will send the Feb. 10 meeting info to a Church Trustee group she belongs to; and propose we meet with Pastor Trent's Pastor Fellowship Group ",

Please contact her in February. In the meantime, she asked that we send flyers that she can pass out at Western. 9/18/15 - sent email re Sept 30 meeting 01/13/16 - left voicemail and email 1/25/16 - received an online inquiry and responded to Bill Saint, Head of the Facilities Cmte. He asked lots of questions, interested in cost of membership and what is involved, as well as, how CPA works. Sent email answering his questions along with one-pagers with more detailed info about CPA. Plans to try a couple of CPA items maybe before but could be after Session approval; meeting on Feb. 9. 2/18/16 - Bill Saint and others will likely not attend the March 8 meeting; but will try paper products and janitorial products, as well as electric pricing.

  "Notes": "10/29/2015 - Talked w both Brian and Krystal - great relational conversation --  currently at 300, want to grow to 1,000 in 5 years. Just got their charter school recently -- but had been doing ministry for 30 years.  Biggest Need: Creative Security Solution. don't want a security guard, but somebody that can be on-call when they need to escort somebody out. perhaps somebody across the street at one of the neighboring charter schools Electricity - after Groundswell electric contract is over.  May be open to gas. (but may not have much) Also looking for space - to  move into a new school middle of 2015-2016 school year -- i.e. Dec 2016 They are currently in the basement of another building and though they have 2 landlords, they are pretty good about providing almost all of their services for cleaning, maintenance, HVAC, Supplies purchasing and copier leasing maybe.
